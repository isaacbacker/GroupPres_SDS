Background 

Who are we / why do we care? 
Stack overflow employees wanting to create a new award to recognize helpfulness 
Maybe making a new badge for “ultimate plant saver” or something  

Background research 
Existing stack overflow badges 
Classification of Helpful Comments on Online Suicide Watch Forums - using ML on human-labeled examples of helpful comments 
We’re not using ML because it’s not interpretable to users in this case 

Methodology

What is helpfulness? 
In this case, providing a timely answer to the users asking the particular questions 
Not including - helpfulness to community as a whole, clarifying questions, etc. 

What is a helpful answer? 
Answered within a reasonable amount of time - 2 days 
Can be an auxiliary chart 
Answer is seen as reliable - accepted (choosing this because it is the best indication of the asker considering it helpful) 
Not including - score, because that is more indicative of helpfulness to other people 

What is a helpful user? The user with the most helpful answers? 
Users that provide these “helpful answers” 

Validation  
Compare with stack overflows reputation as a sanity check 
Maybe look at these profiles manually to double check that this seems reasonable
