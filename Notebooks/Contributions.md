### Contribution
Set up Github repository. Wrote the code for the section on 'when helpful users were the most active' according to month and time of day, and then compared top users against the broader user base. Analysed the results and implications of those results for that section. Matched the user ID to the number 1 user. Presented the section on when helpful users were most active.

Used Claude 4.5 to generate the code for the data visualisation part, as I am not yet familiar with data visualisation in Python. Explained the relevant variables and the type of visualisation I wanted, and then let it create the code for the matplotlib plot.
