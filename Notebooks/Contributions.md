## Isaac Backer

### Contribution
Set up Github repository. Wrote the code for the section on 'when helpful users were the most active' according to month and time of day, and then compared top users against the broader user base. Analysed the results and implications of those results for that section. Matched the user ID to the number 1 user. Presented the section on when helpful users were most active.

### AI declaration
Used Claude 4.5 to generate the code for the data visualisation part, as I am not yet familiar with data visualisation in Python. Explained the relevant variables and the type of visualisation I wanted, and then let it create the code for the matplotlib plot.

## Bruno Kneffel

### Contribution
My contributions to the group work were:
1. Responsible for the PPT presentation, creating strawman, storyline, and slides
2. Exploratory data analysis
3. I contributed in small parts to the cleaning of the code

### AI declaration
Used Claude 4.5 and GPT-5 to help me understand the code written by the others; For matplotlib creating understanding of the syntax and functionality; helping with finding synoyms for the slide presentation 

## Sophie Bair

### Contribution
Made an outline for the presentation, performed analysis on the number of questions asked/answered and the comparison to reputation, cleaned up a large portion of the code, and contributed to the live presentation. 

### AI declaration
I used the AI auto-complete function to finish some code and used Chat-GPT to help me set up the virtual environment and understand how to install the relevant package requirements. 

## Yilin Qian

### Contribution
Participated and helped with drafting early discussions on definition and limitations, explored some possible impact of "score" variable, worked on a small section of the slides and presented the summary part.

### AI declaration
I used Chatgpt 5 to assist in understanding others' codes, debugging my codes while exploring the data, as well as helping to improve the clarity and grammar of my writing.

## Max Davy

### Contribution
Collaborated on definition of helpfulness; wrote initial analysis code defining helpfulness and analysing how a small group of users contributed most helpful answers (Q1), added Spearman correlation and a few minor code changes; drafted slides motivating helpfulness definition and presented on them.

### AI declaration
Limited usage of Copilot auto-complete, otherwise nothing.
