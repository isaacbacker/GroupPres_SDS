## Setup
- Setup your virtual environment for this directory and install the stuff in requirements.txt
    - `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- Note: if you're using 'uv' for your virtual environments, just cd to this directory and run 'uv sync'

## Info
- We chose 'gardening' as our substack forum to study. All of the relevant files output by stack-downloader are in 'data', so no need to run stack-downloader yourself.
- The jupyter notebooks for stack-downloader and the assignment are both in 'notebooks'
